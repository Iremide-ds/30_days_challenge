Updated every weekend and Javascript and/or Typescript are the only allowed languages.

# Setup

How to run the simple Node.js server:

- You need Node.js to be installed on your system. You can download Node.js and follow the instructions on how to do that on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/);
- Clone or download this repository;
- Open your terminal;
- With the command line go to the folder you just cloned/downloaded;
- Type ```npm run start```, so your server start running;
- All results shuld be printed to the terminal if code in index.ts remains untouched.
